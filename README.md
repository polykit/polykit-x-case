# Polykit X Casing

This repository contains OpenSCAD and DXF files to mill a housing for my Polykit X8 polyphonic synthesizer. I used the following acrylic strength:

- Left/right: 10mm
- Top controls: 3mm
- Rest: 5mm

I glued the parts together with methyl acetate and used threaded inlays to fix the PCBs and top panels in place.

In addition there are 3d printable files for the knobs of the input and control board (knurled/d-shaft).
